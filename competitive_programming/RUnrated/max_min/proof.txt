Excercise: Show that given an array of n elements, to obtain both max and min element there is to do at least ( floor( 3*n/2 ) -2 )  comparisons.

Answer: 

Initially there are n elements to be potentially maximum and n elements potentially to be minimum, now notice that the comparisons may decide:

a) if an element is not max
b) if an element is not min
c) both a) and b) i.e an element is not max and other element is not min.

a+b+c minimize with a+b+(2c) = 2n-2, notice that becuase there are at most [n/2] comparisons of type c, then a+b+c is >= 2n-2 + [n/2] = [3n/2]-2
